C-House Interior 

This is an interior design from C-house, where the client gives the opportunity to directly design the interior in the master bedroom area.

where the client wants a clean, comfortable and simple room and not too much color contrast in each area, so we ourselves decided to create a soft and simple concept which only chose two colors, namely white and gray and combined it with natural materials, namely wood.
