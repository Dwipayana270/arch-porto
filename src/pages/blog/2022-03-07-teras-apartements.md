description: The program was to fit 5 apartments in 1st floor and 5 shops on
  ground floor with a 20m x 4.5m size. Because of the deepness on the apartments
  the natural light and ventilation is managed by two patios between rooms and
  main area. Those two patios give natural light to the rooms and ventilate both
  bathrooms. By opening the two patios the cross ventilation will be heading all
  along the apartment.
